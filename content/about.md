Software Engineer but also a human. 

Currently living in sunny Barcelona exploring the realms of the freelance universe. 
Passionate about learning, creating, and sharing.


## **The beggining of a Era**

120mhz, 12MB of RAM, and a disk with the obscene capacity of 1.2Gb!
It was summer of 1997 and that all that you would ever dream of.

- first memories, logo? that app to create postcards? Carmen sandiego?

- From there school palying games, modifying `con` files from duke nukem 3d, playing custom wad files, attempt a whole summer to move quake I (50 mb) on old disquetes of 1.44m (used fix disk to fix them)
- Playing with telnet, Back Orifice, scanning maps, reading the Hacker Manifesto, attempting to recreate a blue box, memorizing the ports and its uses, 

## **Education**

Lic and BE, suffering with ones, enjoying others. 
Decieded to pursue ind eng, instead of cc, thinking that a broader view would be benefitial,
cons and pros of that.


## **Life, here and there**

CL, US, ES,

## **Languages and tools**

I can list dozens of languages that I can “Hello World” in, but I’m not going to. 
Instead, I’ll tell you that I’m currently focusing most of my efforts on Rust, Go, and Dart at this time. 
Particularly, I'm learning Rust, writing Go when it makes sense and looking to grow Dart's developer ecosystem. 

## **Extra stuff that no one asked for...**

When I'm free from obligations, I try to spend time with my lovely wife and two dogs. 
I'll also find time to work on open source projects, my own personal projects, 
and am always trying to find the time to read more. 
If you’re near Louisville, Kentucky, let's go grab coffee and talk about what you're working on!
